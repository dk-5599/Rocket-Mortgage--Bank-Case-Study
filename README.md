# Rocket-Mortgage-Bank-Case-Study

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted data cleaning and understanding through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I created four mock dashboards based on the insights generated from Python visualizations to effectively present key findings. I applied a Logistic Regression model to predict future customer subscriptions and assessed its performance using confusion matrices and classification reports. Based on the insights, I developed a recommendations and established a 6-week execution timeline for implementation.

### Data Set Information

The dataset pertains to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. Multiple contacts to the same client were often necessary to determine if they would subscribe to a bank term deposit ('yes') or not ('no').

### Input Variables

- *Client Data:* Age, Job, Marital Status, Education, Default, Housing Loan, Personal Loan
- *Campaign Contact:* Contact Type, Month, Day of Week, Duration
- *Other Attributes:* Number of Contacts in Campaign, Days Since Last Contact, Previous Contacts, Previous Campaign Outcome
- *Social and Economic Context:* Employment Variation Rate, Consumer Price Index, Consumer Confidence Index, Euribor 3 Month Rate, Number of Employees

### Output Variable

- *Subscription:* Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').

### Problem Statement

Analyze the dataset to extract insights and make recommendations. The goal is to identify factors influencing subscription rates by exploring client data, marketing attributes, and socio-economic indicators. Prepare a presentation to communicate these findings to business stakeholders.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Inspection and Cleaning

During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I began by importing the dataset and performing initial inspections using pandas. I used commands such as head(), shape, and dtypes to examine the datasetâ€™s structure and content.

![Data Types Figure](https://github.com/dk-5599/Rocket-Mortgage--Bank-Case-Study/blob/main/Images/dtypes.PNG)


### Handling Missing Data

- *Identifying Missing Values:* Checked for missing values using isnull().sum().
- *Removing Incomplete Rows:* Removed rows with missing values in critical columns like 'default' and 'contact' using dropna().
- *Imputing Missing Values:* Filled missing values in the 'age' column with the median age using fillna().

## Model Implementation and Evaluation

In this section, I implemented a logistic regression model to predict subscription status based on various features from the dataset. The model was chosen due to the categorical nature of the target variable and the need for probability-based classification.

## Steps Taken:

### Data Preparation:

- *Target and Features Separation:* The dataset was divided into features (X) and the target variable (y). The target variable, y, indicates whether a customer subscribed to a term deposit or not.

### Data Splitting:

- *Train-Test Split:* The dataset was split into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio to ensure that the model is trained on a substantial amount of data while retaining a separate set for evaluation.

### Preprocessing:

- *Numeric and Categorical Columns:* Identified numeric and categorical columns to apply appropriate preprocessing techniques.
- *Standard Scaling:* Applied StandardScaler to normalize the numeric features.
- *One-Hot Encoding:* Used OneHotEncoder for converting categorical features into a format suitable for the model.

### Model Training:

- *Logistic Regression:* Trained a logistic regression model using the preprocessed data. Logistic regression was chosen because it is effective for binary classification tasks involving categorical outcomes.

### Model Evaluation:

- *Accuracy:* The model achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test data.
  
- *Confusion Matrix:* Computed the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

![Confusion Matrix 4 Figure](https://github.com/dk-5599/Rocket-Mortgage--Bank-Case-Study/blob/main/Images/ConfusionMatrix.png)

- *Classification Report:* Generated a classification report detailing precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (Subscriber and Non-Subscriber).

| **weighted avg** | 0.95   | 0.96   | 0.95     | 8156    |


- *Prediction on Sample Data:* Made predictions on a few random samples from the test set to demonstrate the model's capability.

## Recommendations

1. *Targeted Marketing for High-Potential Groups:*

   - *Focus on Educated and Married Clients:* Since university degree holders and married individuals show the highest subscription rates, prioritize these groups in marketing campaigns. Segment customers by education level and marital status to provide tailored messaging.
   - *De-emphasize Low-Potential Groups:* Reduce efforts towards students and clients with low levels of education, as they have lower conversion rates. Adjust messaging for these groups to focus on simpler, short-term financial products.

2. *Re-Evaluate Campaign Touchpoints:*

   - *Optimize Contact Frequency:* Subscribers tend to engage after 4 contacts, while non-subscribers drop off quickly. Focus on quality rather than quantity of contact attempts for non-subscribers. Limit follow-ups after 4 contacts and instead target fresh leads.
   - *Enhance Call Duration:* Longer conversations (14.35 mins) result in more subscriptions. Train call center agents to engage in more in-depth conversations, providing detailed product benefits and addressing client concerns.

3. *Seasonal Campaign Adjustments:*

   - *Increase Campaigns in July:* Despite fewer contacts in July, it has the highest conversion rates. Allocate more resources for campaigns during this month.
   - *Reconsider May Campaigns:* Despite high activity in May, the conversion rate is lower. Focus on improving call scripts and product offers during this period.

4. *Leverage Economic Conditions (Euribor Rate):*

   - *Promote Term Deposits When Rates Are High:* Since subscription rates increase when the euribor3m rate is higher, align marketing campaigns with periods of rising interest rates. Highlight the benefit of locking in a higher rate with term deposits.
   - *Product Design for Low-Interest Periods:* During low euribor3m periods, design alternative products that may appeal to risk-averse customers, like short-term savings or flexible deposit options.

5. *Revisit Loan-Based Segmentation:*

   - *Housing Loan Customers:* Clients with housing loans are more likely to subscribe, so they should be the focus for cross-selling term deposits.
   - *Exclude Default Customers:* Clients with credit defaults are not subscribing to term deposits. Reduce marketing spend on this segment and focus on improving their credit standing first.
